For this project, I built a client application that receives mathematical formulas from a server and evaluates given mathematical formulas. The server will randomly generate a string consisting of the following characters: >, <, +, -, *, /, and the numbers 0-9. The client will receive the strings generated by the server; when all received strings can generate a “grammatically correct mathematical formula”, it evaluates the formula and prints the outcome.

A “grammatically correct mathematical formula” in this project’s context is defined as:
• ‘>’ indicates the beginning of the formula; ‘<’ indicates the end of the formula. The formula is the string between these 2 delimiter characters.
• For a mathematical formula to be correct, between numbers, there can only be one operator (one of +, -, *, /).
• For a mathematical formula to be correct, the formula must end with an equal sign, =.

For example,
• 2+35/2*3= : It is a “grammatically correct mathematical formula”.
• 23+/35*1=2: It is NOT a “grammatically correct mathematical formula”.
• 23+1=2: It is NOT a “grammatically correct mathematical formula”.
